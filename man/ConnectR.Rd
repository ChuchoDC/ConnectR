\title{Performs Biogeographical Bootstrap Analysis with Visualization}
\usage{
connectr(
  file,
  type,
  sheets = "",
  indices = "",
  n_boot = 1000,
  dist_type = "density",
  color = c("blue", "red")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Path to the file to analyze. Can be a .xlsx or .csv file.}

\item{type}{Type of file: either \code{"excel"} or \code{"csv"}.}

\item{sheets}{Sheet(s) to analyze (for Excel files). Use a character vector with sheet names or a numeric vector with sheet indices. Ignored for CSV files.}

\item{indices}{Biogeographical indices to calculate. Options include \code{"BC"}, \code{"AO"}, \code{"AE"}, and \code{"NC"}. Use \code{""} to compute all.}

\item{n_boot}{Number of samples to generate using parametric bootstrap. Default is 1000.}

\item{dist_type}{Type of plot to display the bootstrap distributions. Options: \code{"density"} or \code{"histogram"}. Default is \code{"density"}.}

\item{color}{Color palette range used in plots. Default is \code{c("blue", "red")}.}
}
\value{
A dashboard visualizing the selected biogeographical indices and their bootstrap distributions, along with summary statistics and a timer showing the execution time.
}
\description{
This function processes a biogeographical dataset provided as a .csv or .xlsx file and calculates connectivity-related indices including Biogeographical Connectiveness (BC), Average Occurrences (AO), Average Endemics (AE), and Network Clustering (NC). It applies parametric bootstrap sampling to each selected index and presents the results in an interactive dashboard, accompanied by distribution plots and timing information.

The function also generates a final graphical summary showing the arrangement of the bootstrap distribution plots for all evaluated indices.

         indices = c("BC", "AE", "NC"),
         n_boot = 3000,
         color = c("green", "yellow"))
